##### Name

Finnian Joseph Wort

##### Bio

I come from Llangollen in North Wales. I love creating music and I have pretentiously written a surrealist musical about poker players. I play football regularly, particularly small-sided games because I was previously involved with Warwick University Futsal. My favourite book is Thinking, Fast and Slow. My favourite game is Dark Souls. My favourite films are Trainspotting and Inglorious Basterds. I have a family stretched across the country and because of this I seem to spend an ungodly amount of time on trains.
