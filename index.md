### Welcome to My Blog

The world is full of quirks and interesting things. The aim of this blog is simply to uncover a few of them and present them. I plan on writing about the important and the trivial, the big and the small. The only thing I hope is that my unusual angle, that spans Economics, Psychology and Data Science, will provide some weird perspectives. That along the way, me and whoever decides to read this, will learn something no matter how small or silly.  

**Disclaimer**
- this is not an R blog! Yes R is the primary tool for analysis and presentation but I am not exploring R itself, there are much more qualified people to do that than me.
- This is also not an academic blog! I may bring in Psychology or drop one of my research projects here but ultimately this is not an advertisement for myself as an academic. 

### A Science Blog: the social science behind the weird and interesting 

[A Machine Learning Approach to How Countries Are Dealing With Coronavirus](Covid_model.md) - let's see if we can quantify the efficacy of each country using a Machine Learning model and all the day-by-day, country-by-country data. 

### Academic Work

[A walkthrough of my Inferred Distribution Model](IBDm_md.md) - of how a person may guess a probability density function based on the samples they have received and how rank-based valuations and context effects may come from this.
