### Welcome to This Blog

The world is full of quirks and interesting things. The aim of this blog is simply to uncover a few of them and present them. I plan on writing about the important and the trivial, the big and the small. The only thing I hope is that my unusual angle, that spans Economics, Psychology and Data Science, will provide some weird perspectives. That me, and whoever decides to read this, will learn something no matter how small or silly.  

Disclaimer
- this is not an R blog! Yes R is the primary tool for analysis and presentation but I am not exploring R itself, there are much more qualified people to do that than me.
- This is also not an academic blog! I may bring in Psychology or drop one of my research projects here but ultimately this is not an advertisement for myself as an academic.
