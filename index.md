### Welcome to My Blog

The world is full of quirks and interesting things. The aim of this blog is simply to uncover a few of them and present them. I plan on writing about the important and the trivial, the big and the small. The only thing I hope is that my unusual angle, that spans Economics, Psychology and Data Science, will provide some weird perspectives. Also perhaps some insights into the life of a PhD in social science. The only aim is that along the way, me and whoever decides to read this, will learn something no matter how small or silly.  

### A Science Blog: the social science behind the weird and interesting 

[A Machine Learning Approach to How Countries Are Dealing With Coronavirus](COVID_model.md) - let's see if we can quantify the efficacy of each country in this crisis using a Machine Learning model on all the day-by-day, country-by-country data. 

### Academic Work

[A walkthrough of my Inferred Distribution Model](IBDm_md.md) - of how a person may guess a probability density function based on the samples they have received and how rank-based valuations and context effects may come from this.

**Disclaimer**
- this is not an R blog! Yes R is the primary tool for analysis and presentation but I am not exploring R itself, there are much more qualified people to do that than me.
- This is also not an academic blog! I may bring in Psychology or drop one of my research projects here but ultimately this is not an advertisement for myself as an academic.
